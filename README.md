The diversity of Los Angeles County makes it a a rich place for culture and food. However, Los Angeles County is also known for its urban sprawl and car dependent culture. The county's sprawl makes it difficult to get anywhere without a car. This means places of entertainment which usually involve alcohol for adults. This project aims to explore alcohol related accidents using data from UC Berekeley's, Transporation Injury Mapping System (TIMS). The system tracks DUI crashes across the state but for the purpose of this project, we will focus on Los Angeles County. This project aims to look at when DUI crashes the most, what parts experiance the most crashes, and explore as to why might certain places in Los Angeles County experiance such high DUI rates.
